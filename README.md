# Analysis of PyBer
## Overview
The client has provided two datasets pertaining to a ride sharing app: one containing information on the drivers, and the other containing information on the rides. They have requested statistics using this information that will help them improve access and affordability to the neighborhoods they are serving.
### Purpose
Using the matplotlib and pandas libraries in python, this analysis will calculate summary statistics on rides and drivers across rural, suburban, and urban cities. These statistics include, for each type of city, the total rides, the total drivers, the total fares, the average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver. A multiple line chart will also be constructed showcasing each city type and their total fares each week during a sample period of time at the beginning of 2019.
## Results
The first area to explore is the summary statistics for the different city types that the ride sharing app serves. After merging the datasets, I calculated the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for rural, suburban, and urban cities. Using these stats I created a readable dataframe that will be referenced in the following results, appearing as this:

### Totals
Predictably, the amount of both rides and drivers of the app are the highest in urban cities and the lowest in rural cities. This can easily be explained by the difference in population between the three city types, with urban cities being much more densely populated than suburban cities, which are more densely populated than rural. Interestingly, the only city type with more drivers than rides is urban cities, with 2,405 drivers and only 1,625 rides. The total fares for each city type is a reflection of the total rides for each city type, with urban cities pulling in more money than the other two city types combined at $39,854.38, suburban cities at $19,356.33, and rural cities at $4,327.93. 

### Averages
The average fare per ride actually trends conversely to the totals, with fares being the highest at $34.62 per ride in rural cities, $30.97 per ride in suburban cities, and the lowest at $24.53 per ride in urban cities. This could possibly be due to the differences in the average distance traveled by users in each city type, since locations are generally closer together in urban environments than rural or suburban environments. The average fare per driver mirrors this trend, with drivers making the most in rural environments at $55.49 per ride, suburban drivers making $39.40 per ride, and city drivers making $16.57 per ride. The only city type where the driver actually made less than the average fare per ride was urban cities with drivers making $16.57 for an average ride that costs $24.53.

### Weekly Total Fares
After generating the summary statistics, I grouped the merged data by the type of city the ride took place in and the date of the ride. I then used this to  generate a dataframe that I used to showcase the weekly total fares of each city type in a multiple line chart from January 2019 to May 2019. This chart appeared as this:

The most obvious conclusion to be drawn is that at no point did any city type cross another city type, which means that the urban cities always outperformed the suburban cites, which always outperformed the rural cities. You can also see that each city type seems to contain itself to a certain range of total fares, with no other city entering that range. Rural cities reach from around $100 to $500, suburban cities lie between $750 and $1,400, and urban cities range from around $1,700 to $2,500. This is, of course, a limited sample of the total fares over time, but it does give us some insight into possible trends to the data. 

## Recommendations
The first issue to address is the low usership of the app in rural areas. While there are less people in rural cities, there is a unique opportunity for larger utility in rural communities than in urban. Public transportation is virtually nonexistent in areas outside of urban development, which means that there is less competition for users that do not own their own means of transportation. Targeted marketing of rural areas, discounts for first time users, or a possible tier system with rewards for continued usership could grow a larger user base in an area that's transportation is underdeveloped. 

Another area for growth is the fare per ride in urban cities. While it is understandable that rides tend to be shorter in urban environments, you could encourage longer trips, and therefore larger fares, by introducing a rewards system that is calculated by length of trips instead of number of trips. You could also introduce discounts for longer trips that could encourage users to splurge.

The last area that could use some tweaking is the total drivers in urban cities verses the total rides. It seems there is a surplus of drivers in urban environments that could mean a lower income for each driver and larger expenses for the company. Cutting back on marketing the app as a job rather than a utility may help. Suspending a driver's activation after a period of inactivity, with an option to restart when interested in driving again, may also bring the driver numbers down, as there is obviously a good number of drivers that haven't provided a ride. Suspending inactive drivers may provide a more accurate picture of the data as well, since the average fare per driver will most likely go up if only taking into account the drivers that actually provide rides.
